# Cats vs Dogs Classifier

Welcome to the Cats vs Dogs Classifier project! This repository contains a machine learning model designed to classify images of cats and dogs. This project leverages deep learning techniques to distinguish between these two popular pets with high accuracy.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a classifier that can accurately identify whether an image contains a cat or a dog. This classifier can be useful for various applications, such as automated pet photo organization, real-time pet identification, and more.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classify images as either "cat" or "dog."
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves [insert accuracy]% on the [insert dataset name] dataset.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Comes with a pre-trained model that can be used out of the box.
- **Custom Training**: Option to train the model with your own dataset.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Cats vs Dogs Classifier, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch
- Other dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cats-vs-dogs-classifier.git
    cd cats-vs-dogs-classifier
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

#### Predicting with a Pre-trained Model

To classify an image using the pre-trained model, run the following command:

```bash
python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

Replace `path/to/image.jpg` with the path to the image you want to classify.

#### Training the Model

To train the model with your own dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset in the following structure:

    ```
    dataset/
    ├── train/
    │   ├── cats/
    │   └── dogs/
    └── test/
        ├── cats/
        └── dogs/
    ```

2. Run the training script:

    ```bash
    python train.py --data-dir path/to/dataset
    ```

This will train the model and save the weights to `model_weights.h5`.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the model on a test set, run:

```bash
python evaluate.py --data-dir path/to/test-dataset
```

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of [insert accuracy]% on the test set. For detailed performance metrics, refer to the `evaluation_report.md` file.
